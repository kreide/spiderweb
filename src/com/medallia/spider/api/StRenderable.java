/**
 * Interface implemented by classes that can be rendered by a {@link StRenderer}. In
 * addition to implementing this interface a .st file with the actual StringTemplate
 * source must (with some exceptions documented below) also be created and placed in
 * the same package as the class.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The entry point called by {@link StRenderer} is a method with the following signature:
 * <p>
 * 
 *   PostAction action(...)
 *   <p>
 * 
 * This method is not defined in this interface since dependency injection is used on its
 * arguments. In addition to any objects registered with the {@link StRenderer} instance
 * an object implementing the interface annotated with {@link StRenderable.Input} is available.
 * This object is actually a proxy that handles request parameter parsing; the methods on
 * the interface should have the same name as the request parameter, while the return type
 * should be the type the request parameter should be parsed into. For example:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   @Input interface Params {
 *     Command cmd();
 *     String foo();
 *     int bar()
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *   
 * The action method is declared thus:
 * <p>
 * 
 *   void action(Params p)
 *   <p>
 *   
 * When a method is called on Params the request parameter with the same name as the method
 * is parsed into the given type. By default enums, ints and booleans are supported; custom
 * types can be registered via {@link StRenderer#registerArgParser(Class, spider.api.StRenderer.InputArgParser)}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The return type of the action method can be either void or a PostAction. If void the default
 * PostAction will be assumed, which is to render a StringTemplate; see {@link StRenderer#defaultPostAction()}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The attributes available in the StringTemplate are defined in an interface annotated with
 * {@link StRenderable.Output}. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   @Output interface Values {
 *     V<Foo> FOO = v();
 *     V<List<Bar>> BARS = v();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The {@link #getAttr(spider.api.StRenderable.V)} method is called with each member of this interface. Usually
 * an abstract base class, e.g. {@link Task}, is inherited which implements this method; clients need only
 * call {@link Task#attr()}. The name of the members are in all caps to satisfy the Java naming convention, but
 * the attribute is converted to all lowercase in the template. 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that the StringTemplate rendering will fail if an attribute is referenced without being set.
 *
